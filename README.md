# 5-7_jsminiproj_awsmrc
  This mini project contain HTML,CSS and JavaScript that I have learn from Web Application class and self research.
I did't go class for 2 week,so I watch recording class, searching from google and more.
But this mini project still have bugs and I can't solve them.

  This Mini Project AWMSRC:Awesome RED Clicker maybe called arcade webgame.
  The goal of this game is click circle when it's when they turn to red.
  When you clicked red you will got +1 score but If you clicked when they green or missclicked in empty space your score will -0.5.

  To play this one you can downloaded all content and run HTML in the same file that contain HTML,CSS and JS together.

  Unfortunately, this mini prject have bug when you clicked faster!!'s button and I don't know how to solve this bug but don't worry if you refresh web page, this one still playable.

  So, Thank you for Attention!
